# soemdsp-simd

> Working branch off [`soemdsp-sandbox`](https://github.com/soundemote/soemdsp-sandbox) for
> parameter/smoothing architecture investigation and native DSP binding work.
> Isolated in its own branch + worktree so this stays reviewable independent of
> `master`.

## What lives here

This branch is where the parameter-domain architecture discovery work is
happening: mapping how raw parameter edits, modulation, smoothing, and native
DSP memory sync actually relate to each other in the live sandbox, and
extracting the real seams one at a time rather than guessing at a framework
up front.

### Landed so far

| Change | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **App-wide smoother convergence skip** | Ports `soemdsp::filter::SmootherBase::needsSmoothing()` — a settled, unmodulated parameter stops paying for a one-pole recompute every sample, in both the JS evaluator and the realtime AudioWorklet. |
| **Sabrina Reverb CPU fix** | The native reverb was recomputing 14 delay-line offsets every sample regardless of whether anything was moving. Gated behind the same convergence check — measured ~1.5x faster steady-state processing in a direct WASM timing test. |
| **`advanceSabrinaSmoothing` documented as DSP safety smoothing** | A/B diagnostic (native ramp vs. snap-to-target, output-buffer discontinuity measured directly) confirmed `delaySize`/`diffusionSize` genuinely need this ramp for hard-step/bypass paths (patch load, script writes) — 5.5–7.6x larger discontinuity without it. No measurable effect during an already edit-smoothed drag. LFO parameter smoothing here is flagged as conservative legacy behavior, not a confirmed need. |
| **`applySabrinaDspBindingIfDirty` extraction** | The paramKey dirty-check + `soemdsp_sabrina_reverb_set_params` call — previously an inline block — is now a named helper, so the sample function reads as distinct phases: resolve → bind → execute. Pure extraction, no behavior change. |

### Why this is a separate branch

Each of the above was validated independently (smoke tests, live browser
checks, direct WASM A/B measurement) before landing, and deliberately scoped
small — one seam at a time, not a framework rewrite. Keeping this off
`master` means the parameter-domain map below can keep evolving without
putting unfinished architecture work in front of the sandbox's other
concurrent contributors.

### Where this is headed (not yet implemented)

```
ParameterState        — stored raw/base value
ParameterMeta          — range, unit, display, default, smoothing config
EditSmoothingRuntime   — smooths ordinary parameter motion
ModulationCombine      — combines base + routed modulation sources
ParameterReadDispatcher — decides what needs visiting this block/sample
DspBinding             — dirty-checks and syncs resolved values into DSP memory
DspSafetySmoothing     — optional, DSP-local protection against unsafe jumps
DspExecution           — the actual audio processing
```

Nothing above this line is committed as a generic framework — it's a map for
where future scoped extractions (like the two above) should land, not a spec
for a rewrite.

Optional CLAP host prototype:

```powershell
# Localhost companion prototype for CLAP catalog and instance probes.
# Render Sample has a bounded CLAP bridge.
# Feedback touching CLAP nodes and Live Audio CLAP plans are blocked for now.
python tools\webui-clap-host\webui_clap_host.py

# Windows launcher, metadata inspection on by default:
tools\webui-clap-host\start_webui_clap_host.cmd
tools\webui-clap-host\start_webui_clap_host.ps1

# Optional alternate bind port:
python tools\webui-clap-host\webui_clap_host.py --port 48000
tools\webui-clap-host\start_webui_clap_host.cmd -Port 48000
tools\webui-clap-host\start_webui_clap_host.ps1 -Port 48000

# Optional explicit catalog entry:
python tools\webui-clap-host\webui_clap_host.py --plugin "C:\path\to\plugin.clap"

# Optional native descriptor inspection:
python tools\webui-clap-host\webui_clap_host.py --inspect-metadata

# Optional create/init/destroy probe:
python tools\webui-clap-host\webui_clap_host.py --test-instantiate

# Optional JSON preflight report without starting the server:
python tools\webui-clap-host\webui_clap_host.py --doctor --inspect-metadata

# In the sandbox browser:
# Edit the Host field if the companion is not using http://127.0.0.1:47991.
# Click Copy Host Command if you need the Windows .cmd launcher command.
# Click Connect Local Host.
# Click Diagnostics to read setup counts from the running host.
# Click Refresh Plugins to read the host catalog.
# Add a CLAP Plugin module to store a selected catalog entry.

# Prototype instance API:
# GET /health reports host capabilities.
# GET /health also reports hostConfig: bind host, port, Python executable, scan dirs, explicit plugins, and probe flags.
# GET /diagnostics reports hostConfig, catalog counts, metadata errors, instantiation errors, and missing explicit plugin paths.
# --doctor reports hostConfig, catalog counts, metadata errors, instantiation errors, and missing explicit plugin paths as JSON.
# Capabilities include maxProcessFrames, processBatch, and offlineRenderSessions.
# Current maxProcessFrames default is 48000.

# POST /process-batch
# /process can accept and return bounded planar-f32-base64 audio.
# /process can apply a parameters array before processing the chunk.
# CLAP_PROCESS_ERROR fails the process call instead of returning audio.
# Direct /param and /params writes are blocked while a render session is active.
# Abandoned render sessions are released by an idle timeout.
# A second render/begin is rejected while a non-idle render session is active.
# Render Sample opens one render session per CLAP instance, processes chunks, then closes the session.
# Render Sample requires audioProcessing: true from the host.
# Render Sample requires offlineRenderSessions: true from the host.
# Render Sample uses maxProcessFrames for CLAP process chunk size.
# WebUI CLAP audio lanes flatten every CLAP audio port in host port order.
# CLAP editor status can be detected; supported Win32 clap.gui editors can open when the plugin accepts the GUI sequence.
# CLAP latency is compensated when Render Sample injects returned CLAP output.
# Finite CLAP tails can extend Render Sample up to the bounded tail limit; infinite tails remain metadata-only.
# CLAP state can be saved into patch JSON and restored into a new host instance when the plugin exposes clap.state.
# Reachable CLAP nodes are processed chunk-by-chunk in graph order.
# Independent CLAP nodes in the same chunk can share one batch request.

Boundaries:

```text
The server only writes through explicit save/settings/audio helper routes.
Open Path is restricted to Downloads.
The browser patch graph is demo-scoped state.
The browser compiler is not the production soemdsp scheduler.
The WebUI does not instantiate real C++ DSP objects yet.
Patch files can save current module instances and settings.
Patch files cannot define new module types by themselves.
